# Fish Simulation

This repository contains the code for a 2D fish simulation game in Godot Engine. The simulation features fish with different behaviors that they randomly choose from, including:

- Repulsion fish: Repel nearby fish (including the player) within a certain range.
- Alignment fish: Steer in the same direction as nearby fish, creating a flocking effect.
- Attraction fish: Move towards nearby fish, creating a schooling effect.
