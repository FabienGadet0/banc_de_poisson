# Fish Simulation

This is an attempt to represent a school of fish , following their real life behavior (from what we know about) :

Those behaviors trigger depending on the range between the fish and others.

- Repulsion: Repel nearby fish within a certain range.
- Alignment: Steer in the same direction as nearby fish.
- Attraction: Move towards nearby fish.
